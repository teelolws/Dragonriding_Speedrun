# Dragonriding_Speedrun

Similar to a Speed runners overlay, this will show timers for various points around your Dragonriding Race to show you if you've made progress over your best time. Now you will know much earlier if you've fallen behind, and won't need to wait until you've finished the whole race to find out and try again

After installing this addon, the first time you run a race, your route and times will be remembered. On your next attempt, the UI will appear, showing your times and progress towards each checkpoint around the race.

I could not find a way to detect when you pass through a ring, instead the addon makes a good guess based on when you make big changes in direction.

You can move and resize the UI in Edit Mode!
